iOS WebShell

Currently most hybrid development environments still require the web developer to launch Eclipse or Xcode
to write and/or compile their mobile app, package it, and distribute it via the app stores. These development
environments have their own significant learning curves, and still require the web developer to learn specific
APIs to execute native functions.
The purpose of
webshell
is to circumvent the whole development/packaging effort by creating a custom
mobile browser that facilitates native iOS interaction via a suite of native modal controllers common to
business. These native modal controllers interface with JSON based RESTful web services provided by the
web developer to consume data posted by the device. The native modal controllers also execute JavaScript
based callbacks on the originating webpage defined by the web developer.
webshell
achieves this goal using
custom div tags containing JSON configuration data to enable one or more native features. Those features
include:


•audio recording
•video recording
•signature capture
•barcode/qrcode reader
•location services
•location rendering
•upload / download files
•push notification registration
